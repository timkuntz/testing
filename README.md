# testing
Small test frameworks for various languages.

## summary
This repo contains small test frameworks I can easily copy when I'm working on some sample code and pulling in an existing package is not easy or I want to customize the test output. By no means are these feature complete.

The Ruby code is from Ryan Davis' RailsConf 2016 talk "[Writing a Test Framework from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPr5pmlAq20)". The other (pending) frameworks are based on those features.
